      "description": "The PD Seminar is Harmony Hub's favourite event. It's where you take your beliefs, values, and rules - the blueprint and basis for every aspect of your life - and decide to shape yourself into the person you're capable of being rather than accepting whatever life and circumstance has given you the opportunity to be.\n\nThis is not positive thinking. Its strategy and methodology have transformed people's lives. This is where you identify the source of your pain and suffering and change it - a transformation that is not only long-lasting but also scientifically supported."
